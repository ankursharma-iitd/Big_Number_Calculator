# Big_Number_Calculator
The problem is to build a simple calculator that can perform the following operations : +, -, *, /, sqrt(), pow() and log() on big numbers. The idea is to be able to manipulate very large numbers that are out of range for the usual numeric data types (int, float, long int, double etc.)

Implemented in C using Flex & Bison that computes algebraic, and other logarithmic expressions on very big numbers (represented as an array of single integers).
